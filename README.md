HI! FRIENDS!
THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO HELP NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULES AND REGULATIONS starting with floating islands for water filtration in CANADA. Later on, I would like to make it more international, and with more types of projects!
In the end, you would be to be able to submit your location, a given set of parameters, and then, the website would help you know what permits and authorizations you need to ask from your governement and/or municipality to ensure the compliance with local environmental norms.


LET'S DEFEAT THE RED TAPE AND HAVE MORE PROJECTS GOING !!!!!üêü
